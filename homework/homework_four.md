# Homework Three

## Preamble

You should submit a single `.py` with all questions answered.  Make sure the answer to each question appears in a function, a series of functions or a class.  The name of each function or class will be specified in the question.  Do not deviate from the name provided, otherwise you will get zero points for that question.

## Question One

Part One)

write a function `is_linearly_independent` that takes in a matrix and returns True if the matrix is linearly independent

Part Two)

write a function `is_basis` that takes in N and a matrix.  It returns True if the matrix is a basis in R^N.  

Part Three)

write a function called `can_multiply` that takes in two matrices and checks if they can be multiplied.

## Question Two

Part One)

write a function `generate_vector_py` that takes in a variable and then returns a vector with random elements of size variable.  This function should use the random library.

write a function `generate_vector_np` that takes in a variable and then returns a vector with random elements of size variable.  This function should use the numpy library.

Part Two)

write a function `multiply_vectors_py` that multiplies two vectors.  This function should not use any libraries.

write a function `multiply_vectors_np` that multiplies two vectors.  This function should use the numpy library.

Part Three)

write a function called `det_py` that takes the determinant of a list of lists of size 2 by 2.  This function should not use any libraries.

write a function called `det_np` that takes the determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix.  This function should use numpy.
