    "In general a computer program is a series of commands called code that get executed in order.  Every application on your computer is just a series of these programs.  So anything you can do on a computer, you can automate with programs.  For instance, say you want a song to play at 8am every morning from your computer, you can write a program for that.  Suppose you want automatically transfer money from your savings to a diversified portfolio of investments, you can write a program for that.  Suppose you'd like to automatically detect when you are out of toilet paper and order more?  That too can be automated, with a little help from sensors around the house.  Many things can be automated.  And the point of computer programming, is to automate them.  \n",
