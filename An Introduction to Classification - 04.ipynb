    "## A Statistical Model Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have looked at statistical models that carry out the regression task.  That is, they take in a set of one or more variables and produce a number.  Specifically, when we say regression we mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y} = mX + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right hand side:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `X` is a tensor of one or more variables.  When `X` represents a single variable, we call it a vector.  And when `X` represents more than one variable we typically refer to it as a matrix.  However, it is also possible for `X` to represent higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`m` and `b` are just scalars, typically from the real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left hand side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y}$ is also typically from the real numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And we say that we regress X on y.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important things to note about this procedure is the nature of $\\hat{y}$, because it is from the reals it's output carries distance.  That means:\n",
    "\n",
    "if for a given set of X's $\\hat{y}$ = 5.32 and for another set of X's $\\hat{y}$ = -1.83 then we can say that the output of the first set of variables is strictly higher than the output of the second set.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not always the case that our output being metrizable, that is being measurable in terms of distance, is useful.  It may be the case that our output should not carry any sense of distance or comparison in anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we need to introduce a new statistical task, that of classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind classification is, what if we output a $\\hat{y}$ that was categorical rather than continuous?  We've already seen categorical variables in the Applying Statistical Tests chapter.  But more formally, a categorical variable is one in which the different classes are just that, classes.  They are just designations.  So let's say we had two classes, A and B.  They could be classes of anything.  Like tall and short people.  Or young and old people.  Or different flavors of ice cream.  As much as people might try to rank order these different classes, neither is truly better than the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to try a fun experiment, ask some friends what they think about different classes of things, like maybe whether it's better to be young or old, better to be tall or short, better to eat vanilla or chocolate ice cream.  I bet, as long as your friends aren't too similar, they'll all answer differently.  And that's the point!  There is no objective ordering of any of these classes.  And therefore, we cannot define an explicit metric to rank them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what?  How are categorical variables useful?  Well turns out they have tons of uses!  We used them extensively in Applying Statistical Tests!  Specifically some of the demographic variables and the converted variable were all categorical.  Without categorical data, we'd never be able to model any of that!  And then we'd be greatly constraining the set of problems we can solve with statistical modeling and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully I've convinced you that classification is cool!  Now let's look at a basic definition of it, so we can compare against our regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Discriminant Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start our analysis of classification by looking at Linear Discriminant Analysis.  This technique was invented by great Ronald Fisher along with many of the other foundations of statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the problem set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have two classes and a bunch of data about the population in general.  The data about the population of interest is referred to as features of the data.  And the two classes are called the labels or target.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this practical, let's set up a discrete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you want to understand whether someone is likely to vote republican or democrat in the up coming election.  Let's assume you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age\n",
    "* Salary\n",
    "* Location\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first generate the dataset, and then we can start to go over the technique:"

This is the general framework for interpretting an already fit logistic regression.  It helps us motivate the link function (if you don't understand link functions, see the chapter on linear regression) for logistic regression.  However, this intuition does not translate towards fitting a logistic regression model.  This is because our dependent variable is Bernoulli distributed rather than normally distributed.  This implies, we do not have a closed form solution and therefore cannot apply least squares to our transformed linear model.  Therefore we must make use of an iterative model to carry out our logistic regression.  For this we will use stochast gradient descent.\n",

    "1. The cost function - We never explicitly talked about this, so what is our cost function?  Here we use cross entropy loss.  This is discussed in detailed in the An Introduction To Information Theory chapter so we won't cover it in detail here.  However let's at least note the formula:\n",

    "2. The cost never converges - We might look at this and think, is our logistic regression implementation faulty?  And in fact, when first looking at this, that is what I thought as well.  But I think this is actually correct.  The reason it doesn't converge is because there isn't a connection between the independent and dependent variables.  Any connection that an algorithm picks up, is in fact a spurious connection.  So we shouldn't expect to see a convergence!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. percent correct - This is basically accuracy.  It counts the number of times the predicted label - true label is zero.  This will be the case whenever the label is correct.  As you can see logistic regression struggles with this quiet a bit!  And for the reason stated above, all associations are spurious.  Therefore we shouldn't expect logistic regression to do better than random!  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why we initialize the cost so high - the reason we start the cost so high is to ensure the learning process kicks off.  If we start the cost at zero, then the condition `cost > tolerance` would not hold and we would learn nothing!  We set it that high because tolerance is a setable parameter.  And it is highly unlikely someone would randomly choose a tolerance that high.  Yet of course, tolerance should always be a relatively small number!\n",

    "Which is almost double!!! So even small changes in our coefficients lead to large shifts in the decision boundary.  So logistic regression can be sensitive to underfitting and overfitting.  Therefore care ought to be taken.  This sort of explains why scikit-learns implementation is scaled and regularized by default.  You want to be sure about your parameters!!  Because being off by a little can lead to large shifts in decisions."
