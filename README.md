By 

_Eric Schles_

Hello and welcome to my book!  You'll find the following sections:

1. [Descriptive Statistics and Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/EricSchles/datascience_book/blob/master/1/Statistical%20Tests%20-%2001.ipynb)
2. [Applied Statistical Tests - A/B testing](https://github.com/EricSchles/datascience_book/blob/master/1/Applying%20Statistical%20Tests%20-%2002.ipynb)
3. [Regression Introduction](https://github.com/EricSchles/datascience_book/blob/master/2/An%20Introduction%20to%20Regression%20-%2003.ipynb)
4. [Classification Introduction](https://github.com/EricSchles/datascience_book/tree/master/3)
5. [Information Theory, Entropy and Tree Models](https://github.com/EricSchles/datascience_book/tree/master/4)
6. [Neural Network Models](https://github.com/EricSchles/datascience_book/tree/master/5)
7. [Introduction to Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/EricSchles/datascience_book/tree/master/6)

Each section covers about 4 to 5 chapters worth of material broken out into:

* Basics
* Mathematical Intuition
* Implementation
* Typical API
* Advanced Use Cases

In addition to the main chapters, I've added a number of 'engineering' focused chapters that are somewhat supplemental:
