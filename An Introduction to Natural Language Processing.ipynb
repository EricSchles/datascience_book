    "# An Introduction to Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of natural language processing is primarily concerned with teaching machines to process and \"understand\" text.  It is fairly straight forward for machines to understand structured data like numbers, however to understand language is far more difficult.  Part of this has to do with the nature of numbers versus the nature of language.  Specifically, words can have multiple meanings in multiple contexts.  While the mean behind a number can change, based on its reference, the definition of a number is consistent across all mediums and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this discrete, if you have 5 chairs or 5 starfish, while the type of thing being described changes, the quantity of things being described stays constant.  However, with language we cannot make such a claim.  For instance, let's look at the following sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I hope you do a great job!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken out of context, its meaning is most likely that the narrator is expressing hope to the subject to do a great job.  Let's see the same sentence in another context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Person1: \"I am going to have the best project\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Person2: \"Yea, right, you know I'll do better\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Person1: \"I hope you do a great job.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Person1: \"Not\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Person2: \"No need to be sarcastic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here \"I hope you do a great job\" is intended _sarcastically_ so the meaning of the statement is reversed, despite us not changing the phrasing of the sentence, the _meaning_ has changed completely.  How do we even begin to encode something like sarcasm in our language?  Would a person even do that in a context we care about?  These are just some of the exciting questions of natural language processing!  \n",

    "## The Bag Of Words Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To get to a point where we can effectively model language, we need to consider it grounded in some task.  Here our task will always be the same, at a high level, how does a machine understand language?  You'll find the specific tasks that follow are mere consequences of this overarching theme of first, how do we understand language?  And as a secondary question, what aspects of language are useful for our specific understanding?  Therefore, any model, in principal will be interested in segmenting natural language into a decomposed or component state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with our first model and a specific sub-task, which will inform what's important.  Here we consider the bag of words model and the task of simple information retrieval.  \n",

Most stop word lists are standard and come from analysis of major bodies of text called corpora or corpus in the singular.  From these corpora are massive bodies of text, that are supposed to capture the frequency of language in a general setting.  Of course, domain specific corpora exist as well.  For instance, words in the medical community are likely to have a different frequency and usage than in say the gaming community.  So we can differentiate dialetics and communities, in theory, from the language they use and directly from the frequency and occurence of different types of words.\n",

In a way, textual data is more complex than other forms of data, because it has both of these features.  Together, the two effect human language in subtle, yet important ways.  \n",
