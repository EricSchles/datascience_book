## Preamble

You should submit a single `.py` with all questions answered.  Make sure the answer to each question appears in a function, a series of functions or a class.  The name of each function or class will be specified in the question.  Do not deviate from the name provided, otherwise you will get zero points for that question.

Question )

Write a function called `select_last_ten` that uses a sql query and the above `sql_query` function to get the last ten elements of a pandas dataframe.  The dataframe will be passed in.  Return the last ten elements.  Note: Order is not guaranteed in a sql query, so please account for this in the query.

Question )

Write a function called `min_max_pd` which takes in a dataframe and a column which must be in the dataframe.  It then returns the 95 percentile of the column times the 12 percentile of the column.  You must use pandas syntax.

Question )

Write a function called `aggregate_median` that takes in a dataframe and returns the median of each column in the dataframe.

Question ) 

write a function called `modulo` that applies the modulo operator two variables.  The modulo operator in python looks like this `%`.

Question )

write a function called `is_odd` that checks if a variable is odd.

Question )

write a function called `counter_plus` that counts from start to finish where start and finish are passed in to the function.

Question )

write a function called `median_index` that returns the median index in a list.

Question ) 

write a function that reverses a list called `reverse`

Question )

write a function called unique that takes in a list and returns it's unique elements, preserving the original order they appeared in the list.

Question )

write a function called `array_product` that takes in a list and returns the product of the numbers.

Question )

Write a function called `second_smallest_distance` that finds and returns the second smallest distance of all the adjacent numbers in a list.
