# Homework Seven

## Preamble

You should submit a single `.py` with all questions answered.  Make sure the answer to each question appears in a function, a series of functions or a class.  The name of each function or class will be specified in the question.  Do not deviate from the name provided, otherwise you will get zero points for that question.  Make sure to return at the end of all functions, never print.

## Question One

Read in the data from `homework_eight.csv` using pandas.  Save it in a dataframe called `df`.

## Question Two

Notice the independent variables end in the word feature and the dependent variable is called target.  

Do exploratory analysis on the data - explain what you've learned.

## Question Three

Come up with a hypothesis for a suitable model for your data.  Are all of your features meaningful?  If so why, if not, why not?

## Question Four

Given your proposed model, run a regression and assess both the fit as well as the explanatory power of each of your variables.  Do any of your variables warrant removal from the model?

## Question Five

Create a visualization of your regression using seaborn.  Here is a hint: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/regression.html

## Question Six

Perhaps you found a model that fit, perhaps not.  Try some other linear or non-linear models.
