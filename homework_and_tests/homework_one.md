# Homework One

## Preamble

You should submit a single `.py` with all questions answered.  Make sure the answer to each question appears in a function, a series of functions or a class.  The name of each function or class will be specified in the question.  Do not deviate from the name provided, otherwise you will get zero points for that question.

## Question One

Part One)

write a function called `hello_world` that returns "Hello World!"

Part Two)

write a function called `summation` that adds two variables.

Part Three)

write a function called `subtraction` that subtracts two variables.

Part Four)

write a function called `multiplication` that multiplies two variables.

Part Five)

write a function called `division` that divides two variables.

## Question Two

Part One)

write a function called `is_even` that checks if a variable is even.

Part Two)

write a function called `mad_libs` that takes in a string and a set of variables.  It returns the string with all the variables passed in, inserted into the string.  Make sure to use `{}` for each variable you pass.  Additionally make sure that the number of `{}` and the number of variables match.

Part Three)

write a function called `counter` that counts from 0 to "n" where n is passed in to the function.

## Question Three

Part One)

write a function that returns the first element of a list called `first`.

Part Two)

write a function that returns the last element of a list called `last`.

Part Three)

write a function that returns the middle element of a list called `middle`.

Part Four)

write a function that reverses a list called `reverse`.

## Question Four

Part One)

Write a function called `mapping` that takes in two lists returns a dictionary.

Part Two)

write a class called `Animal` with the following:

Instance variables:
	* `number_of_legs`
	* `number_eyes`
	* `name`

Methods:
	* `print_name` - return the name of the animal
	* `speed` - return the speed of the animal with the following formula:
		number_of_legs * 2.73
