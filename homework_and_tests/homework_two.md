# Homework Two

## Preamble

You should submit a single `.py` with all questions answered.  Make sure the answer to each question appears in a function, a series of functions or a class.  The name of each function or class will be specified in the question.  Do not deviate from the name provided, otherwise you will get zero points for that question.

## Question One

Part One)

write a function called `array_sum` that takes in a list of numbers returns their sum.

Part Two)

write a function called `min_max_diff` that finds the maximum of a list of numbers and the minimum of a list of numbers and subtracts the two.

Part Three)

write a function called `average_distance` that finds the difference between every adjacent set of numbers in a list and then takes the average of all the differences.

## Question Two

Part One)

write a function called `is_palindrome` that checks if a string is the same backwards and forwards.  Returns True if the string is an palindrome.

Part Two)

write a function called `is_pangram` that checks if all the letters in the alphabet are in the string.  Returns True if the string is a pangram.

Part Three)

write a function that counts the occurrences of each letter in the string and returns a dictionary.

Part Four)

write a function called `is_anagram` that takes in two strings and returns True if you can rearrange the letters of the first string to get the second string.
