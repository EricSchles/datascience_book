# Homework Three

## Preamble

You should submit a single `.py` with all questions answered.  Make sure the answer to each question appears in a function, a series of functions or a class.  The name of each function or class will be specified in the question.  Do not deviate from the name provided, otherwise you will get zero points for that question.

## Question One

Part One)

write a function called `return_array` that takes in a list and returns a numpy array.

Part Two)

write a function called `to_matrix` that takes in two lists and returns returns a matrix.

Part Three)

write a function called `to_tensor` that takes a vector and a matrix and returns an order three tensor.

## Question Two

Part One)

write a function called `greater_than_average` that takes in an array and returns all the elements greater than the average.

Part Two)

write a function called `dense_array` that slices the array to all elements within one standard deviation of the mean.

Part Three)

write a function called `mean_median_density` that slices the array between the mean and median.  The function returns the ratio of the length of the slice against the size of the full array.
