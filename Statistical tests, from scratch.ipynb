    "# Statistical tests, from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will build up the foundations of statistical tests.  Starting from a foundational example and building on our understanding from there.  We will be implementing some statistical tests in order to deepen our understanding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical tests come to us from descriptive statistics.  By making use of descriptive statistics in conjunction, we can build up to analytic tools for discerning truth.  In this way, we can see a statistical test as a clever use of descriptive statistics in order to better understand the world around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundational Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with the foundational example, that of milk poured into tea and tea poured into milk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that a person claims they can tell the difference between tea poured into milk and milk poured into tea.  Such an ability may seem unlikely.  But how unlikely is it?  One way to verify whether or not an individual poses such an ability is to devise an experiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, all of science is either experimentally or theoretically evaluated.  Where experimental evaluation is always done via the use of statistics and probability to evaluate the data of an experiment.  And theoretical evaluation comes to us from the manipulation of equations to discern truth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go through the logic of the experimental design for this experiment, see if you can come up with your own experimental design.  What would you account for in your experiment?  How would you ensure you can trust your results?  What is your null hypothesis?  What is your alternative hypothesis?  How sure will you be of your results?  And how will you know?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are many of the foundational questions one needs to consider before starting out an experiment.  I think this blog post does a decent job of introducing more on the topic of experimental design: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-you-need-to-know-a-b-testing-f2f12aff619a\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, the set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher randomly decide whether to pour tea into milk or milk into tea for eight cups of tea.  Then he presented the eight cups of tea to the person claiming to be able to tell the difference.  Here the null hypothesis is that the person cannot tell which tea cup is which.  The alternative hypothesis is that they cannot.  If the person gets all eight tea cups correctly, then the researcher believed we could reject the null hypothesis and that it was likely the alternative hypothesis was true.\n",
    "\n",
    "How likely was it that the alternative hypothesis was true?  Well thats actually easy to calculate.  Because there are eight cups of tea and each was randomly assigned to case one and case two, that meant that there was no conditional information between cups of tea.  This means that the probability of getting all eight cups of tea correct is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{2^{8}} = \\frac{1}{256} \\approx 0.003 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is less than a 1% chance that the person gets all eight cups right, given that they were guessing.  So if they do get all eight right, we should assume there is a pretty good chance that they know how to tell the difference.  But is that enough?  Are we confident in saying that this person knows how to do this?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Well one way you could check is run the experiment multiple times on multiple days and check the results.  The chance of any individual one of these tests getting the alternative hypothesis goes up, but it's increasingly likely that the typical case will emerge for most of the tests.  How likely a test is to fail to give a correct response is related to its statistical power - the chance of getting a false positive.  This general procedure of running an experiment multiple times is called a replication study and it is crucial to science.  If you cannot replicate an experiment, then the experiment should not be trusted.  But I digress.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some general features of our experiment that we should make explicit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our tea took on one of two states - tea poured into milk or milk poured into tea.  In general we usually break up our experiment into two possible cases - test and control.  In the test set a \"treatment\" is applied and for the control set either no treatment is given or a placebo is given.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enough trials were performed during the experiment to make the possability of an accidental false positive fairly unlikely.  In this case, a less than 1% chance.  For some experiments this is nowhere near enough tolerance.  It really all depends on what you are trying to measure and how important getting it right is.  The industry agreed upon standard is 5% margin of error, which might be good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the experiment, we should not be 100% confident in our results.  We should be reasonably confident.  We should be as confident as the margin of error, in this case about 99.7% confident.  But we should not, nor should we ever really be 100% confident in a result.  And we should increase our confidence only after some number of replication studies have been performed.  This shows us the importance of creating experiments where replication is relatively easy to perform.  If replicating our experiment is very, very hard, then it might be a bad experiment.  Of course, it all depends.  \n",

    "# Writing Our Own Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to set up an experiment, let's come up with a set of statistical tools to help us test hypotheses in general, without having to calculate the specifics of the test every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing T-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of t-tests.  For each t-test we will be using a worked example to illustrate how to use our implementation.  Technically any test is a t-test if the test statistic follows a t-distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example One - Designing a good enough pilot cockpit\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you are a military contractor and you need to come up with a cockpit for pilots.  If the cockpit is too big, then the plane will not be economical and cost way too much.  If the cockpit is too small then the plane is useless and won't work for enough pilots.  So figuring out what a good size cockpit is, is imperative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, prior to the current leadership, this problem was solved by selecting pilots that were of a certain maximum height and build.  However, a study from a government think tank showed that pilot effectiveness is partially tied to height because athletes tend to be taller, and have better hand eye coordination.  Therefore the old constraints are being thrown out and all future candidate batches are being tested for core competency on a simulator and then the top 10% of pilots are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been supplied with the heights of the candidates that passed as well as the population of heights for current pilots.  Do we need to design a plane design because we need a new cockpit?\n",
    "\n",
    "### One Sample T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The one sample t-test is perfect for this problem, assuming both populations are normally distributed.  The way all hypothesis tests are done is first you calculate a test statisitic and then compare it against a set of critical values for some reference distribution.  In our case, we will be looking at a t-value as our test statistic and comparing this against critical values from the t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the t-value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s.e.} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* s.e. is standard error:= $\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}} $\n",
    "* $ \\bar{x} $:= sample mean\n",
    "* $ \\mu $ := population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we pass the calculated t-value from the above equation into the cumulative density function for the t-distribution along with the degrees of freedom, defined as $ n-1 $.  This gives us the p-value.  Note that the p-value is the same value we calculated above in the example - it is the probability of seeing a test statistic as extreme as the one we found.  So if our p-value is very low, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis, in this case, that the sample and population mean's are close.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering, why do we make use of the cumulative density function?  Upon inspection of its definition, the answer should become obvious:\n",
    "\n",
    "The cumulative density function \"accumulates\" the density of the probability up until that point.  Mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{i=k} p_{i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some value k.  If k = $ \\infty $ then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{i=k} p_{i} = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we see that our CDF is the density of the probability up until the t-value.  Therefore, by plugging the t-value for k, we get the total probability up until that point.  By taking 1 - CDF up to k=t-value, we are able to recover how much probability is \"left over\" such that our null hypothesis is true."

    "\n",
    "Since we've already looked at this example a bit, we'll continue forward with it to answer another question.  Now that you've found that you'll likely need to redesign all the cockpits for the various planes, it's time to do some more digging.  We should make absolutely certain that the original study, which presented this notion about athletic ability and it's tie to being an effective fighter pilot.

This question is important, because it will have an effect on your recommendation for how big or how varied the cockpit sizes will be.\n",
