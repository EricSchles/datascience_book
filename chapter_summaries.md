Part 1. Computer Science

In this part of the book we will introduce the Python programming language.  In order to motivate this we will introduce algorithms, data structures, discrete mathematics, calculus, linear algebra, combinatorics, graphs, differential equations.

Part 2. Data Science

This is the content that has been written, and will be expanded.

Part 3. From Computer Science to Data Science

In this part of the book we will introduce a number of NP-Complete algorithms and then approximate them using data science.  The central tenets of this section will be built off of:
